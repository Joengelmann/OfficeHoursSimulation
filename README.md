This program simulates a professors office hours throughout a semester. In the simulation, the user can decide how likely a student is to show up, and how many office hour sessions they will have. I made 26 students, named StudentA-StudentZ, and 26 topics, named a-z, that the students can ask about, but this can be changed easily in the code. When the simulation is done, a handful of summary statistics will be printed to the terminal. In addition, 2 folders will be created. The first is TopicOutputFolder which will contain a a .txt file for each office hour session showing what topic students asked about. The second is StudentOutputFolder which contains one .txt file showing which students asked about what topic at what session. This file can be sorted four different ways. Finally, the terminal will allow you to search for any student or topic of your choice and see all the relevant information.

To try the simulation on your own, make sure to compile Office5.cpp with C++11. Thanks!
